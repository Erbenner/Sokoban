# Sokoban
This my first game, designed by Erben in 2016.

Sokoban is a classic 2D game, you can control the protagonist around through push "up","down","left","right".And if you find something wrong, try to push "R" to restart the game.Also , if one level is a little hard to you, you can push "B" .
When all of the box were push to the  target area, you win.
